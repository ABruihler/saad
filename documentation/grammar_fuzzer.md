# Grammar Fuzzer

This document gives a brief outline of the grammar fuzzer included with SAAD. More information can be found in the [grammar fuzzer README](../scripts/probes/grammar_fuzzer/README.md).

The code is located in ../scripts/probes/grammar_fuzzer/ and was originally developed in a separate repo (so look there for a more complete commit history): https://github.com/skimberk/first-fuzzer
