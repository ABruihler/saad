# Background

SAAD was created by Anders Bruihler, Ari Conati, Sebastian Kimberk, & David White as part of their [Carleton College CS major comps project](https://www.carleton.edu/computer-science/major/comps/).  It was developed Winter-Spring terms 2020.

## Inspiration

SAAD was inspired by ["Lightweight Source Code Monitoring with Triggr"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3238147.3240486), a paper (and associated [tool](https://github.com/lyzerk/Triggr)) by Alim Ozdemir, Ayse Tosun, Hakan Erdogmus, and Rui Abreu.  This paper is from the 2018 Automated Software Engineering conference, presented in the Tool Demonstrations section.  

Triggr sought to create a distributed, flexible, and fine-grained source code monitoring solution, and many of the same ideas and approaches are adopted in SAAD.
